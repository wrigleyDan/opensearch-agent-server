"""Helper functions for create_run_route to reduce complexity.

This module extracts cancellation handling and event stream management logic
from the main route handler to improve maintainability and testability.

**Key Functions:**
- `emit_cancellation_events()` - Emit cancellation error and finish events (with retry logic)
- `check_and_handle_cancellation()` - Check cancellation status and handle if canceled
- `consume_event_generator_with_cancellation()` - Consume event generator with cancellation checks
- `yield_events_from_queue()` - Yield events from queue with timeout handling
- `create_event_queue()` - Create bounded event queue with backpressure handling
- `put_critical_event_with_retry()` - Queue critical events with exponential backoff retry

**Usage Example:**
```python
from server.run_route_helpers import (
    consume_event_generator_with_cancellation,
    yield_events_from_queue,
    create_event_queue,
)

async def cancellable_event_stream():
    event_queue = create_event_queue()
    generator_done = False
    generator_error = None

    async def consume_event_generator():
        nonlocal generator_done, generator_error
        generator_error = await consume_event_generator_with_cancellation(
            event_generator, run_id, thread_id, encoder, event_queue
        )
        generator_done = True

    task = asyncio.create_task(consume_event_generator())  # noqa: RUF100  # task ref passed to consumer; intentionally not stored
    async for event in yield_events_from_queue(
        event_queue, task, generator_error, run_id, thread_id
    ):
        yield event
