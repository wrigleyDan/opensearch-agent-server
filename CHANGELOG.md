# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- PPL reference skill and skills auto-discovery for the default agent
### Fixed
- Default agent now respects `BEDROCK_INFERENCE_PROFILE_ARN` env var instead of silently falling back to a hardcoded Sonnet 4 model (fixes #94)
- Tool calls now appear in the correct position in the UI instead of at the end of the preceding text message; upgraded `ag-ui-strands` to 0.1.9 which properly emits `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` before `TOOL_CALL_START` (fixes #75)
### Removed
